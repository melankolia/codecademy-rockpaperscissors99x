To complete this project, your code will need to contain the following:

Twelve global variables representing each player's move types and values 
(3 move types and 3 move values for each player). 
These variable names should be in the form of 
playerOneMoveOneType, playerOneMoveOneValue, etc.

A function called setPlayerMoves, 
which will take a string representing a player (in the form of 'Player One' or 'Player Two'), 
three move types, and three move values, and set the correct global move variables. 
The method signature for this function should be 
as follows: setPlayerMoves(player, moveOneType, moveOneValue, moveTwoType, moveTwoValue, moveThreeType, moveThreeValue).

A function called getRoundWinner, 
which takes a round number (1, 2, or 3), 
compares both player's move types and values for that round, 
and returns the appropriate winner ('Player One', 'Player Two', or 'Tie')

A function called getGameWinner, 
which compares both player's move types 
and values for the whole game and returns the 
appropriate winner ('Player One', 'Player Two', or 'Tie')

Bonus: A function called setComputerMoves, 
which chooses three random moves for player two. 
The move type for each move should be completely random, 
and the move values should be random but add up to 99.
